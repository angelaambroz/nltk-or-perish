Teaching myself: NLTK, web scraping, other stuff
=======

### Summary

September 2015. Working through the [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/). Scraping academic papers, analyzing them. Hypothesisless.



### Resources
* [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book_1ed/)

### TODO

1. ~~`git`.~~
2. ~~Make `def` for scraping text, converting PDF to TXT.~~
3. Basic text data cleaning: eliminate `\\n`, etc.
4. ~~`FreqDist` common words.~~
5. Language diversity?
6. Data visualizations of everything.
7. Add more sources/corpi. (Compare to non-academic? Compare over time?)
8. Refactor code into: `scrape.py`, `clean.py`, `analysis.py`, `visualize.py`, or something.
9. Most common word endings.
10. Sentence length.
11. `FreqDist`: instead of abs values, convert to `%` of total wordcount.
12. Return a random sentence.
